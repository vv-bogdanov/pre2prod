# Manual Flight Plan

## Goal

Run every Pre2prod phase against this repository, one phase at a time, without
automatic checkpoint commits. After each run, inspect the diff and logs, write
a report with recommendations, fix confirmed Pre2prod bugs or maintenance
friction, and only then move to the next phase. Finish with a consolidated
report and recommendations for bringing the CLI to an appropriate state of the
art for its MVP scope.

## Rules

- [ ] Keep `main` clean; run the campaign from one dedicated working branch.
- [ ] Use `--no-commit` for every phase run.
- [ ] Run one phase only; never continue automatically to the next phase.
- [ ] Do not discard a Worker diff without an explicit decision after review.
- [ ] Treat non-applicable phases as an evidence-based PASS, not a reason to add
      irrelevant product features.
- [ ] Keep phase reports and the final report outside product commits unless a
      report becomes intentional repository documentation.
- [ ] Store reports in `.pre2prod/reports/`; after reviewing a Worker plan,
      preserve a copy there and remove `PRE2PROD_PLAN.md` from the repository
      root before the next clean-start run.

## Preparation

- [ ] Create and switch to the dedicated flight branch.
- [ ] Confirm a clean working tree and record the baseline commit.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run check`.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run build`.
- [ ] Confirm the phase list with `pre2prod --list`.
- [ ] Prepare a report entry for each phase with: phase, slug, run ID, model,
      outcome, reviewer findings, Worker actions, changed files, validation,
      tool issues, recommendations, and commit decision.

## Per-Phase Procedure

- [ ] Run `pre2prod -p <phase-slug> --no-commit --max-iterations 1`.
- [ ] Record the run ID, model/provider, branch, and elapsed result.
- [ ] Inspect `git status`, `git diff --check`, `git diff --stat`, and full
      `git diff`.
- [ ] Inspect `PRE2PROD_PLAN.md` when a Worker ran.
- [ ] Inspect summary and full logs filtered by run ID, role, and turn.
- [ ] Verify the commands and checks claimed by the Worker independently when
      relevant.
- [ ] Write the phase report and recommendations.
- [ ] If the change is acceptable, archive or remove `PRE2PROD_PLAN.md` as
      appropriate and commit the reviewed change manually.
- [ ] If Pre2prod itself has a confirmed bug or harmful maintenance friction,
      fix it with focused tests, validate it, and rerun the same phase.
- [ ] If the Worker change is not acceptable, stop and decide the next action
      before modifying or discarding it.
